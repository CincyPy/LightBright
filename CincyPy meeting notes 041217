Met at Wunderbar

This meeting was held to inform the group about the Blink Cincinnati Event.
"Running October 12 - October 15, BLINK Future City will be light, street art, murals, and live performance. It will spread across twenty blocks of Cincinnati; rising up from The Banks, stretching through Downtown and Over-the-Rhine to historic Findlay Market, reimagining our city as a stage.
BLINK will spotlight emerging and renowned artists from around the globe, bringing them to Cincinnati to collaborate with the talented creatives who call this city home. This is an invitation-a challenge, perhaps-to join the collaboration and "plug in".

Deadline for light installations and sculpture grants is May 1.

Funding will be awarded to about 20 project ranging in value from $250-20,000.

Jim, Lisa and Akeem discussed some possibilities for the CincyPy group in general:
1. It sounds like there is enthusiasm for a "Northern CincyPy".
2. Some of us are more likely to stay with the Northern Kentucky (NKy) CincyPy, perhaps focusing specifically on the "LightBright", or creative coding aspects of python.
3. We agree the group would benefit from some leadership, common goals, scheduling and meeting format. For example: Explore using Processing.py. Each person learns something and shares it with the group. The meeting format could be weekly meetings:
20 minutes of sharing either a project, or some area of interest
20 minutes helping others, or demonstrating
20 minutes planning next steps - working towards a larger goal, like the Blink event.
Ann agreed to post on the Meetup site about regular meetings at the NKy site.
4. Since Patrick initiated the LightBright focus, Lisa will ask him to weigh in on leadership.
5. Better communication tools will help the cohesion of the group. 

Lisa will not be at the April 19 meeting.
